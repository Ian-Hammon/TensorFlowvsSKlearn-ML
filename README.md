# TensorFlowvsSimple Linear Regression-ML
Machine Learning Algorithm using TensorFlow and SKLearn
These are simple linear regression models using SKLearn and TensorFlow. 
The SKLearn model is using data that came from the Udemy class "The Data Science Course: Complete Data Science Bootcamp 2025". The data include GPA and SAT information about students. SAT is the independent variables and is used to predict the dependent Variable GPA.
Process: 
Use the simple linear regression model to predict a high school students GPA in college based on their SAT scores.

The TensorFlow mode is a randomly generated data model and is used to hightlight the differences between SKLearn and TensorFlow coding. The warnings you see in the SKLearn model is a warning of memory leak, and is not an indication of incorrectly writen code. Both models work and are useful for predictions in the datasets they were trained on.
